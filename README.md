# 30 Days of Computer Vision
### This is my Curriculum for finishing the Computer Vision Nanodegree in One Months.

#### Start Date
December 23, 2019

This is a repository for all my 30 days of Computer Vision Nanodegree. At the end of this 30 Days of Computer Vision challenge journey, I would like to build a rich portfolio of Computer Vision Skills and projects. And most importantly finsih my computer vision Nanodegree, earn my computer vision nanodegree and become a Udacity Alumni.
